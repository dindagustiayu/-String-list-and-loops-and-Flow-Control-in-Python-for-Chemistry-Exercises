## 1. Strings
## P3.1
Produce a nicely formatted list of the values of the physical constants, _h_, _c_, $k_{B}$, _R_, and _$N_{A}$_, to four significant figures, with their units.

## P3.2
The following variables define some thermodynamic properties of $CO_{2}$ and $H_{2}O$.

## P3.3
Nuclear binding energy and the mass defect. A neutron has a slightly larger mass than the proton. These are often given in terms of an atomic mass unit, where one atomic mass unit (u) is defined as 1/12th the mass of a carbon-12 atom.

## 2. List and Loops
## P3.4
Straight-chain alkanes are hydrocarbons with the general stoichiometric formula $C_{n}H_{2n+2}$, in which the carbon atoms form a simple shain: for example, butane, $C_{4}H_{10}$ has the structural formula that may be depicted $H_{3}CC_{2}CH_{2}CH_{3}$. Write a progra, to output the structural formula of such an alkane, given its stoichiometry (assume $n\geq1$).

## P3.5
Produce a table if the FCC element symbols abd their corresponding atomic radius (nm) and atomic weight (g/mol).

## P3.6

Alumunium, copper and lead has an atomic radius of 121, 132, and 146 nm, respectively, an FCC crystal structure, and atomic weight of 26.98, 63.55, and 207.20 g/mol. Compute their theoritical density,and compare the answer with their measured density.

in the FCC unit cell illustrated, the atoms touch one another across a face-diagonal, the length of which is _4R_. Because the unit cell is a cube, its volume is $a^{3}$, where _a_ is the cell edge length. From the right triangle on the face.

$a^{2} + a^{2} = (4R)^{2}$

Solving for a,

$a=2R\sqrt{2}$

The FCC unit cell volume $V_{C}$ may be computed from

$V_{C}=a^{3}=(2\sqrt{2})^{3}=16R^{3}\sqrt{2}$
